            <h1> Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by animated film directors Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, and has
                produced twenty-two feature-length films. Most Studio Ghibli films ranked number one at the box office
                in Japan in the year in which they were released.

                SPIRITED AWAY, directed by Hayao Miyazaki and released in 2001, is the all-time highest grossing film in
                Japan, earning over 30 billion yen at the box office.
                <br /><br />
                Studio Ghibli films have garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim from film critics and animation
                specialists around the world. SPIRITED AWAY was awarded the Golden Bear as the Best Feature Film at the
                2002 Berlin International Film Festival and won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.
                In October 2001, Studio Ghibli, in conjunction with The Tokuma Memorial Cultural Foundation for
                Animation, founded the Ghibli Museum, Mitaka, designed by Hayao Miyazaki.

            <p> THE WIND RISES (2013), THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA (2013), WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE (2014) and THE RED
                TURTLE (2016), the last four films released by Studio Ghibli, have earned the studio four consecutive
                Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature Film. The studio is currently working on a new
                production.
                <br /> <br />
                Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Pom Poko and others Ghibli movies explore the cost of power. The
                films are known for their worlds of magic: witches and wizards and spirits (oh my), not to mention
                transformations and mystical tokens galore. But just as in the Grimms' fairy tales, magic in Ghibli
                features isn't always what it seems. Ghibli heroes marvel at magic, but aren't wholly taken in by it.
                They present it in most instances as a system of commerce: you may use magic, but there will inevitably
                be a price.
            </p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <p> Trusting in some mystical panacea only gives characters the illusion of power and control,
                and it usually strips them of something vital in return. In the world of Studio Ghibli, that may mean
                losing their freedom or humanity, or their previous way of life.
                <br /><br />
                But in a more realistic sense, it may simply mean characters have to sacrifice their conception of their
                existence in the world, and lose their sense of personal responsibility. Like in fairy tales, the touch
                of magic may provide some glamour and awe, but magic beans and magic lamps come with a cost. They never
                ultimately solve the problems, they just change them. Unfortunately, the actual work of fixing the world
                will always fall on us.
